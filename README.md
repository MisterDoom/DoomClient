DoomClient, a fork of idfk that does nothing but reskin it.

to start without building the client just do 
`npm i`
then do
`npm start`
if you for some reason do want to build just do 
`npm run dist` after building the client, a new directory named dist containing executable binary files (.exe, .dmg, or .AppImage) will be created (existing files will be overwritten).
